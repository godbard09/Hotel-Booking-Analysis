# Project Overview
The project centers around the analysis of hotel booking data, specifically focusing on bookings, cancellations, and revenue from 2014 to 2017. The data provides insights into the overall performance of the hotel, customer demographics, booking trends, and financial outcomes. The project aims to visualize key metrics, such as customer origins, booking patterns, and distribution channels, in order to make informed decisions for improving the hotelâ€™s operational efficiency and financial growth.

# Insight
* **Booking patterns:** The data shows a steady increase in bookings over the years, indicating a growing demand for hotel services. However, cancellation rates also increased significantly from 2014 to 2017, suggesting a potential issue with booking reliability.

* **Lead time:** The average lead time for bookings fluctuates over the months, with certain months showing a higher tendency for long lead times. Understanding these fluctuations can help optimize pricing strategies and improve operational planning.

* **Customer types:** A significant proportion of the customers are classified as "Transient" (individual guests), with smaller portions booked under "Group" and "Contract" categories. This suggests that the majority of the bookings are for short-term, individual stays rather than long-term corporate or group events.

* **Revenue distribution:** Revenue from bookings is heavily reliant on the direct distribution channel (for both corporate and individual customers). The trend suggests that focusing on increasing direct bookings could enhance profitability by reducing dependency on third-party distribution channels.

* **Room preferences:** The Average Daily Rate (ADR) across different room types shows significant variability, with some room types consistently fetching higher rates. This could be linked to seasonality, customer preferences, or promotional pricing strategies.

* **Special requests:** A portion of bookings includes special requests, which could be further explored to understand customer preferences and enhance the service offering.

# Recommendations

* **Optimize cancellation management:** Implement more effective cancellation policies or promotional strategies that incentivize guests to honor their bookings. A focus on reducing the number of cancellations could lead to increased revenue stability.

* **Target transient customers with personalized offers:** Based on the booking trends, there is an opportunity to optimize pricing strategies and increase marketing efforts during off-peak months.

* **Enhance revenue management:** Use historical lead time and ADR data to refine pricing strategies. Understanding booking lead times allows the hotel to anticipate demand and adjust prices dynamically, maximizing revenue for rooms with higher demand.

* **Leverage direct booking channels:** Continue efforts to promote direct bookings, possibly through loyalty programs, exclusive offers, and user-friendly booking interfaces, which would reduce reliance on third-party platforms and improve profitability.

* **Focus on special requests:** A deep dive into special requests could lead to improved customer satisfaction. This could help in developing a more personalized service and uncovering hidden revenue opportunities through custom packages or services.
